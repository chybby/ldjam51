# Morning Coffee Hit

It is 8AM and the morning coffee rush is beginning. Can you keep up with customers coming in every 10 seconds and asking for more and more complicated drinks?

Controls:
  - Mouse to look around.
  - WASD to move.
  - Left click to pick up, interact and drop.
  - Right click to throw *ahem* gently pass an order to a customer.
  - Esc to pause and change settings.

Try to survive all 15 morning rushes and give the customers their morning coffee hit!

A few of the textures (the customers and the floor) are based on this texture pack: https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/pirate-bomb

Every other sprite and model was made during the jam.
